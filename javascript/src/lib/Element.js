 * Factory method to create a new React element. This no longer adheres to
 * the class pattern, so do not use new to call it. Also, instanceof check
 * will not work. Instead test $$typeof field against Symbol.for('react.element') to check
 * if something is a React Element.
 *
 * @param {*} type
 * @param {*} props
 * @param {*} key
 * @param {string|object} ref
 * @param {*} owner
 * @param {*} self A *temporary* helper to detect places where `this` is
 * different from the `owner` when React.createElement is called, so that we
 * can warn. We want to get rid of owner and replace string `ref`s with arrow
 * functions, and as long as `this` and owner are the same, there will be no
 * change in behavior.
 * @param {*} source An annotation object (added by a transpiler or otherwise)
 * indicating filename, line number, and/or other information.
